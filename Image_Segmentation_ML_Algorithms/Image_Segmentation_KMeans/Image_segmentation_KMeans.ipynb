        "## Project Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "This project implements **K-Means clustering** for color-based image segmentation. K-Means is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that partitions an image into K distinct regions (clusters) based on color similarity. This approach is particularly effective for segmenting images with distinct color regions.\n",

        "\n",
        "**K-Means** is an unsupervised learning algorithm that groups similar data points into clusters. In the context of image segmentation:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Each pixel is treated as a data point in 3D color space (R, G, B)\n",
        "- The algorithm groups pixels with similar colors into K clusters\n",
        "- Each cluster is represented by its centroid (average color)\n",

        "### Algorithm Steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Initialization**: \n",
        "   - Reshape image into a 2D array where each row is a pixel (with R, G, B values)\n",
        "   - Randomly select K initial cluster centers (colors)\n",

        "2. **Assignment Step**:\n",
        "   - Assign each pixel to the nearest cluster center\n",
        "   - \"Nearest\" is determined by Euclidean distance in RGB color space\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Update Step**:\n",
        "   - Calculate the mean color of all pixels in each cluster\n",
        "   - Move cluster centers to these mean positions\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Iteration**:\n",
        "   - Repeat steps 2-3 until convergence\n",
        "   - Convergence occurs when cluster centers stop moving significantly\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Reconstruction**:\n",
        "   - Replace each pixel with its cluster center color\n",
        "   - Reshape back to original image dimensions\n"
