        "# Image Segmentation using Adaptive Thresholding\n",

        "\n",
        "This project demonstrates **adaptive thresholding**, a powerful technique for image segmentation that handles varying lighting conditions across different regions of an image. Unlike global thresholding which uses a single threshold value for the entire image, adaptive thresholding calculates the threshold for smaller regions, making it ideal for images with non-uniform illumination.\n",
